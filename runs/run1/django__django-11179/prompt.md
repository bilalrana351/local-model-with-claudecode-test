You are working in the Django repository at /testbed, checked out at the commit where the issue below was reported.

<issue>
delete() on instances of models without any dependencies doesn't clear PKs.
Description
	
Deleting any model with no dependencies not updates the PK on the model. It should be set to None after .delete() call.
See Django.db.models.deletion:276-281. Should update the model line 280.
</issue>

Resolve the issue by editing the non-test source files in /testbed.

- Find the code involved, reproduce the problem if practical, then make a minimal, correct fix.
- Run the relevant existing tests to check your change, for example:
  `cd /testbed/tests && python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite --parallel 1 <test_module>`
- Do not modify or add files under /testbed/tests. Your fix will be checked against hidden tests.
- Do not commit. When the fix is in place and the tests you ran pass, stop.
